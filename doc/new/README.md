# Documentation

Circa 2018-2019, Nathan started collecting new documentation here.  Prior 
documentation was sparse and out dated, and Nathan wanted a good place to 
keep notes about new devlopments.

## Viewing

Run:

    mkdocs serve

from the folder containing this README file.  This folder has the `mkdocs.yml`
file required to serve the site.

## Bulding

Instead of just serving the rendered (html) documentatation, it's possible
to build the html:

    mkdocs build

This will put all the generated files in a `site` folder.

## Requirements

* [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and associated `python` installation.

#This file is a template for use with the test data set provided with the software package.
#Use the pound symbol (#) for comments.

#================== MAIN PARAMETERS ==================

#Aspect ratio of X- and Y-coordinates versus Z-coordinate
anisotropyZ=4

#Image background level (set conservatively)
backgroundThreshold=3

#Tau level for generating an initial set of supervoxels from the hierarchical segmentation of watershed and persistence-based clustering
persistanceSegmentationTau=3

#Sigma of gassian filter used for background detection and subtraction (see below options); recommend values between 10 and 30, or 10x radiusMedianFilter
sigmaGaussianBlurBackground=20

#Floating point value 0 to 1 to use Gaussian-blurred image for background detection -- background will be called when pixel values in the blurred image are below (backgroundThreshold * this number) -- turning this on may have aggressive background removal effects, please audition results
useBlurredImageForBackgroundDetection=0.7

#Floating point value - weight of blurred image prior to regional background subtraction; the blurred image is multiplied by this number (suggest value between 0.5 and 1), then subtracted off prior to segmentation
weightBlurredImageSubtract=0.6




#================ ADVANCED PARAMETERS ================

#NOTE: These parameters were not changed between the various runs presented in the associated paper.
#Most of these parameters should not be altered. However, you can modify them if required by your data.

#--- Variational inference for Bayesian GMM

#Prior probability for centroid position of a nucleus based on its most recent position. If cells are moving fast this parameter should be set close to zero. If cells are moving very little, and the position at time t is a good prediction for the position at time t + 1, this parameter should be set to 1 or greater
betaPercentageOfN_k=1.9

#Prior probability for shape change. If objects change shape rapidly between two consecutive time points this parameter should be set close to zero. If object shapes change very little between time points this parameter should be set to 1 or greater.
nuPercentageOfN_k=0.3

#Prior probability of track death, with lower values accomodating of greater numbers of tracks that die off
alphaPercentage=0.8

#Boundaries for Gaussian shapes
#aux=scaleSigma/(maxRadius*maxRadius) with scaleSigma=2.0 and maxRadius=10 (adjust with scale)
#The larger the value of regularizePrecisionMatrixConstants_lambdaMin, the larger the ellipsoids fitting each nucleus can grow.
regularizePrecisionMatrixConstants_lambdaMin=0.02

#aux=scaleSigma/(minRadius*minRadius) with scaleSigma=2.0 and minRadius=3.0 (adjust with scale) (the shape of the fluorescently-labeled chromatin can become highly anisotropic when nuclei divide)
#The lower the value of regularizePrecisionMatrixConstants_lambdaMax, the smaller the ellipsoids fitting each nucleus can shrink
regularizePrecisionMatrixConstants_lambdaMax=0.8

#Maximum excentricity allowed: sigma[i]=1/sqrt(d[i]). maxExcentricity needs to be squared to relate to the radius.

estimateOpticalFlow=0

#Distance (in pixels) to consider nearest neighbor cells for coherent optical flow
maxDistPartitionNeigh=80.0

#If positive, optical flow module will be activated automatically if the number of deaths exceeds this value. Usually, when large movements occur, many Gaussians dissapear, i.e. this circumstance can be used to activate optical flow.

#Maximum distance (in pixels) of nearest neighbors to consider when building the spatio-temporal graph for tracking
maxDistKNNsupervoxel=40.0

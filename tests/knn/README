This code looks pretty old.

It's from the UtilsCUDA version of knnCUDA and looks like it's 
the test code used during the initial implementation.

It needs some work to convert it into a standing/useful unit test.
Such a test would certainly be pretty useful.

Things get a little more complicated because different knn implemnentations are
used by the GMEM code and the temporalLogicalRules code.  The two knn's are 
closely related.  It looks like the temporal logical rules one might be a little
newer.

This test code was with the implementation used with GMEM.

\brief calculate tracklets using Hungarian algorithm between super-voxels in two time points T0 and T1

\param in svList0 list of input super-voxels. We use supervoxel.nearestNeighborsInTimeForward to calculate candidates and correspondence
\param in distanceMethod. 0->Jaccard distance between supervoxels; 1->Scaled Euclidean distance between centroids
\param in thrCost cost assigned to an edge that goes to the garbage potential

\param out assignmentId resized to length svListT0.size() to hold solution. assignmentId[jj] holds an iterator pointing to the candidate supervoxel within a list<supervoxel>. 
\param in If no assignment has been made (garbage potential wins), then assignmentId[jj] = nullAssignment;

\brief given a lineage, calculates tracklets based on calculateTrackletsWithSparseHungarianAlgorithm. lht needs to have temporal neighbors calculated for each supervxoel before calling this function

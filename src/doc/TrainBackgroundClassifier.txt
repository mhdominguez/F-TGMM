HOW TO TRAIN BACKGROUND CLASSIFIER


1.-You need to parse CATMAID annotations into binary files (with segmentation information) in your own hard drive.

	CATMAIDinterface::mainCATMAIDinterface.cpp::mainParseMatchHS2CatmaidAnnotations

2.-Parse the annotations from CATMAID generated in step 1 into training data (confidence = 4 -> background; confidence = 5-> foreground ). Training data is a generic xTrain, yTrain arrays.

3.-Train classifier (it will save a txt file with the generated classifier )

4.-(Optional) Active learning: run the classifier on the data and check the results in CATMAID to improve training set

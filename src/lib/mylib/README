# Mylib

MSVC will take a long time to build the release version of mylib.

It's also a part of the code base that never really changes.  To reduce 
build times, I'll build a static optimized version here and check the 
static library in with the repository.  This will have to get updated for
different operating systems.

# Building

The `scripts` folder has scripts to help build and configure things.
Those scripts invoke the CMake build system to generate, for example,
a Visual Studio solution.  MSBuild is then invoked to actually build 
everything.  So many layers!
